# integration

* http://github.com/clbustos/integration

## DESCRIPTION:

Numerical integration for Ruby, with a simple interface

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Use only one method: Integration.integrate
* Rectangular, Trapezoidal, Simpson, Adaptive quadrature, Monte Carlo and Romberg integration methods available on pure Ruby. 
* If available, uses Ruby/GSL QNG non-adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration and QAG adaptive integration, with support for Infinity+ and Infinity- 


## SYNOPSIS:

  Integration.integrate(1,2,{:tolerance=>1e-10,:method=>:simpson}) {|x| x**2} => 2.333333
  
  # Support for infinity bounds with GSL QAG adaptative integration
  
  normal_pdf=lambda {|x| (1/Math.sqrt(2*Math::PI))*Math.exp(-(x**2/2))}
  Integration.integrate(Integration::MInfinity, 0 , {:tolerance=>1e-10}, &normal_pdf) => 0.5
  Integration.integrate(0, Integration::Infinity , {:tolerance=>1e-10}, &normal_pdf) => 0.5
  
## REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby/GSL, for better performance and support for infinite bounds

## INSTALL:

  gem install integration
